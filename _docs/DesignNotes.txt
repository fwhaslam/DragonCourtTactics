=============================

I have decided that player strategic progress will revolve around hero 'slots'.
As the player completes more dungeons thus collecting more resources, he can use 
his rewards to purchase and upgrade slots.

The player should start with one slot that only allows a single peasant.  The 
first round of puzzles should involve evading the enemy and luring them into traps.
The player should be able to upgrade the first slot to have some of the weaker 
battle classes, then get a second slot, then finally get some of the support 
classes.  ( battle = guard, archer, halbadier; support = thief, healer, mage ).

We could also have limited equipment slots so that the players can have a small
numbr of healing potions and the like.

Dragon Court Tactics will be a fantasy dungeon game that resembles tactical 
combat but is actually a puzzle.

The game becomes a puzzle because there is no random chance.  All terrain is 
visible, all enemy actions are predictable, all trap mechanics are fixed.

The game feels like tactical combat in that there are characters with movement 
and health which inflict damage.  Progress is turned based.
