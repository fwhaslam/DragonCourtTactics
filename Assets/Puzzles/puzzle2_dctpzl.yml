  Start: Adventurer, my name is Corin Thea.  
    On behalf of the City Watch I am seeking your help.  
    There have been incidents with small monsters 
    cropping up throughout the duchy.  
    Imps and ratfolk, ghosts and goblins.  
    A child was stolen near Olivers Creek from a farm family.  
    The watch is short handed right now, 
    so we are hiring cheap mercenaries like you 
    to take care of these things.
    I know that you have no training, 
    but goblins are cowardly creatures.  
    You should be able to intimidate the beast into 
    returning the girl.
    While you are at it, 
    see if you can find out why there is so much trouble right now.
  Done: good job, here is some money.
